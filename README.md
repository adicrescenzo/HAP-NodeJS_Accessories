# HAP-NodeJS_Accessories

This is just an example to how configure multifunction accessory that use MQTT on HAP-NodeJS

I'm using [Sonoff Dual](http://sonoff.itead.cc/en/products/sonoff/sonoff-dual) with the [Tasmota](https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/) firmware installed onboard. 

This firmware makes the Sonoff able to connect to an MQTT broker like Mosquitto
